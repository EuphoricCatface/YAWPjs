# Yet Another Word Puzzle (js)
Porting my [Yet Another Word Puzzle](https://github.com/EuphoricCatface/yet-another-word-puzzle), based on [Wordle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FatCatStudios.Wordle) - No, not *the* Wordle, but existing one on Android.

Made because urging friends to install Python and PySide (possibly on top of Windows) is frustrating, quite frankly  
(By the way, I figured packaging a PySide project can be done with [cx_Freeze](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/deployment-cxfreeze.html))
